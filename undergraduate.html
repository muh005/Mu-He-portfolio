		<ul></ul>
		<p>This is a blockchain application which focus on tackling the problem of giving 
		credit equally to all the contributors. It is a distributed system which make 
		referencing other people's work more easily and the prize is more fairly distributed
		by all the contributors with people who you collaborate and previous work you 
		referenced to solve this problem. This project is a first step into the world of the 
		blockchain. This is an interesting field that definitely need more work on it and is

    <ul></ul>
		<p>This is a MongoDB-Express-AngularJS-Node.js based website which aim to enhance information exchange and social networking. With the growing demand for internship resource, we find out that traditional social media might not be powerful enough. Society media, such as wechat and facebook, cannot hold resource permanently. In order to hold information, as well as, to enhance social networking, we invent this CBSforum. We hope people who come here will have better job opportunity and they can bring more job resource back later.

    <p>From our experience, University students do not want to attend lectures and study a course alone because learning is a boring process. Therefore, they are happy to find someone to go to a lecture together and study the same course in the Geisel Library. This Android application will target students who 1. Take class(se) without friends 2. Prefer group-study to self-study 3. Want to make new friends. This MeetSB is still in progress and we are looking forward to publishing it.</p>

        <h2 class="text-primary">UCSD pircnet study</h2>
        <p class="text-primary">Research Assistant. @ Weibel’s Lab in UC San Diego Sep.2018 - 2019</p>
        <p> UCSD pircnet study is a study which researches on natural language processing and image processing. In the
            information era, there are a lot of tweets contain detrimental text or image. In our lab, we train model
            on text and image, and give them labels. With machine learning, we are able to analyze huge amount of text
            and image efficiently.
            In this experience, I worked as a research assistant which help implement a website to collect information
            and labels for tweets. I also research on natural lanaguage processing model and image processing model. I
            want to thank especially to professor Weibel Nadir who guides me through the learning.
